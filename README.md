# XeltriaOS: A Public Domain Real-TIme Operating System for AARCH64

Right now i wouldn't say the OS is there yet in terms of functionality, but my goal is to make n operating system where the public has as much control as possible (even more free then those GNU people, think about it GNU/Linux Users), 


will probably die out as a project soon but im hoping it becomes something
